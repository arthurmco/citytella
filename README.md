# Citytella

Citytella is a city-building game with a network protocol based on P2P
networking, with a central server only for tunneling the cities
communications. 

Citytella (and all of its files) are released under the MIT license.

*Much of these features aren't implemented yet.*

(TODO: shall I move the features to the wiki? )

## Cities

Each city will not be an independent block, with only ligations for other
cities. You will be able to commercialize with them, and they will be able
to commercialize with you. 

You will be able to sell, for example:
 
 - energy
 - water
 - sewage
 - road maintenance
 - railroad maintenance
 
You too will be able to make commercial deals with other cities, to sell,
for example, raw materials. (e.g if your city produces iron ore, then
you will be able to sell these to a city that produces things with iron)

## People

People won't let your city too easy, but there's a chance that they
will. For most of the time, they will live in your city, but will work
and/or spend money in the city they want if your city doesn't have what they
want. For example, if your city shoppings' are crap, they will go to some
other city, if your city has the best electronic shops of all time, they
will come in your city. 

For people leave your city, your city needs to not have both of these
things, for a determinate social class:

  - jobs
  - nice neighborhood (e.g a big fucking nice house next to a poor
    neighborhood)
  - some sort of recreation (some classes will want even more than one)
  - schools and studying places

If there's some city that is nice in any of these fields (even of subfields
of these, like 'shoppings' are a subfield of 'recreation'), they will gain
attention of the people of your city. Don't be jealous: you *can* make deals
with them, like some sort of school intercourse.

If you want your city to be big and grow , please be the best in your
neighborhood in at least something.

## Graphics

I don't aim for very good graphics (but I want some nice graphics), but for
a very good experience.
